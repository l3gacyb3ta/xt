# XT - A Fish eXTension pack!

I personally use fish on my home machine, and there are some things that I do so a lot , so I decided to write a [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) extension!

The commands are as follows:

`xtman <name of command>`: Read a man file through some processing, then display it in zathura.  
`xtmd <file>`: Turn a markdown file into something zathura can read (HTML I think), then display it in zathura.
